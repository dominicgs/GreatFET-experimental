# GreatFET Python Package and Utilities

This software is developed for python3.  It should be compatible with python2,
but we do less testing with python2 and plan to drop python2 support in the
future.

## Installing or Updating Software

Unless you are developing software or testing software from git, you can
install or update GreatFET software with:
```
sudo pip3 install --upgrade greatfet
```
