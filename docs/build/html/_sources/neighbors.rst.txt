rough ideas
~~~~~~~~~~~

    - RNG
    - DAQ
    - pulse generation (TTL)
    - arbitrary waveform generation
    - magstripe
    - barcode
    - dual cc1101
    - cc1200 + cc2500 for rfcat-like functionality in Sub-GHz and 2.5 GHz
    - cc1352 for WiFi, BLE 5, Zigbee, Thread, Wireless M-Bus, 802.15.4g, 6LoWPAN, KNX RF, Wi-SUNÂ®, and 2FSK/4FSK proprietary protocols
    - Fieldbus Neighbor with CAN, RS-232, TIA-422, TIA-485 (possibly support for two of these neighbors operating at the same time for MitM and other dual interface abilities)
    - ODB-II ?
    - DTMF
    - NFC/RFID
    - DPA
    - JTAG (like bus blaster and/or Black Magic Probe) (could be satisfied by Foxglove)
    - SX1257 (SDR, no FPGA needed)
    - SD card
    - clock generator (for multi-HackRF)
    - ultrasound
    - USB Type-C sniffer
    - LCD
    - nRF8001
    - general comms: Ethernet, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc.?
    - one or more of the Cypress Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth chips formerly owned by Broadcom
    - KNX
    - mmWave sensor/radar
    - energy harvesting (buck/boost)
    - USB Type-C power delivery, accessory mode, alternate mode breakout/sniff/hack
