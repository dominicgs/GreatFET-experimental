Kniphofia
================================================

Kniphofia is the code name for an FPGA neighbor. It features an iCE40HX4K FPGA and can be used to remap pins on the neighbor interface.

Kniphofia uses surface mount pin headers on both the top and bottom. The digital pins do not pass through from top to bottom; instead they are mapped through the FPGA.



Pin Usage
~~~~~~~~~

Certain pins such as the power supply and I2C will pass through. Most of the digital pins will be remapped by the FPGA.



Design Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

iCE40HX4K-TQ144 is the lowest cost part that would be sufficient. If we decide we need more pins, we would need to select a more expensive BGA part. We'll supply the iCE40 with a clock generated by the LPC4330. Serial configuration will be done by the microcontroller. 1.2 V regulator required?

SMT pin headers may have durability problems when stacking and unstacking neighbors. Investigate headers with board lock options. Maybe glue the headers to the PCB.

Do we want to length-match SGPIO and/or EMC traces?

Possibly add SRAM.
