# GreatFET Firmware

The primary firmware source code for GreatFET devices is greatfet_usb.  Most
of the other directories contain firmware source code for test and development.
The common directory contains source code shared by multiple GreatFET firmware
projects.

## Updating Firmware

Unless you are developing firmware or testing firmware from git, you can update
the firmware on your GreatFET device (to match the version of software
installed on your host) with:
```
gf fw --auto
```

## Building and Installing to Flash

The firmware is set up for compilation with the GCC toolchain available here:

https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm

Most Linux distributions maintain a package for the toolchain; this is the
peferred method of installation.  For example, on Debian based systems:
```
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

Required dependencies:

* https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/libgreat
* https://github.com/dominicgs/libopencm3

If you are using git, the preferred way to install these dependencies is to use
the submodules:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then install the host tools (see ../host/README.md).

To build a firmware image for the GreatFET One:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DBOARD=AZALEA
make
```

If building for another board, replace ```AZALEA``` with the the
appropriate board string. The following board strings are currently recognized:
 * `AZALEA` for the GreatFET One/Azalea.
 * `NXP_XPLORER` for the LPC4330 Xplorer.
 * `RAD1O_BADGE` for the CCCamp 2015 rad1o-badge.

If you're using a CCCamp rad1o badge, follow the instructions for installing
as a l0adable below.

If you're using a GreatFET device that didn't come pre-flashed (e.g. one you
made yourself), or using a stock NXP Xplorer, follow the instructions for DFU
mode below to start off by running the GreatFET firmware from RAM. You can then
use this firmware to program the device's flash.

If you're running a GreatFET One or NXP Xplorer that's already flashed with a
GreatFET firmware, you can load your newly-built firmware using the following
command:

```
make greatfet_usb-flash
```

(You'll need the GreatFET tools installed for these commands to work. See
../host/README.md)

Your GreatFET should reset and start running the new firmware. You can check
the software version by using the gf info tool:

```
# gf info
Found a GreatFET One!
  Board ID: 0
  Firmware version: git-87f4da4
  Part ID: 300a00a0394358
  Serial number: 0000000000000000ffffffffffffffff
```

## DFU Mode: Running from RAM


If your board doesn't currently have GreatFET firmware (e.g. if you built the
board yourself, or if you're using a NXP Xplorer), or your firmware's in a bad
state, you can temporarily load firmware into RAM using the LPC4330 DFU
bootloader. Once the firmware is running, you can then opt to write the firmware
to flash so will persist across reset.

For loading firmware into RAM with DFU you will also need:

http://dfu-util.gnumonks.org/

Each of the currently supproted boards provides an accessible DFU bootloader:
 * To start up GreatFET One in DFU mode, hold down the DFU button while powering
   it on or while pressing and releasing the RESET button.
 * To start the LPC Xplorer in DFU mode, adjust the J4 switches so SW1-4
   are OFF, ON, OFF, and ON respectively, and then press the reset button. To
   resume loading from flash, restore them to so SW1-4 are OFF, ON, ON, ON.

Once the GreatFET is in DFU mode, run the following command from your firmware
build tree:
```
make greatfet_usb-program
```

You should see a blinking LED, indicating that the GreatFET firmware is running
and alive.

If you want to continue to program the flash, you can then issue the "flash"
command while the firmware is running.
```
make greatfet_usb-flash
```

## Installing as a l0adable

If you have a rad1o badge, you can install the firmware as a "l0adable"
application-- which maintains the ability to use your badge's normal functions.

First, you'll need to build the GreatFET firmware using the instructions above.
It's important that you specify the `-DBOARD=RAD1O_BADGE` option above in order
to ensure that the firmware is built and linked as a l0adable.

Next, boot your rad1o in USB Mass Storage mode by holding the joystick UP
while powering on the device. The screen should display:

```
MSC enabled
```

To install the GreatFET application, find the `greatfet_usb.bin` file, which
should be located in greatfet_usb/greatfet_usb.bin (asuming you followed
Building and Installing to Flash above and are in the build directory).

To install, you'll need to rename this binary to a filename ending in `b1n`
on the badge's UMS device. It's recommended to do this from a terminal, rather
than from the UI on your machine:

```
# Assuming the rad1o badge has been mounted to /Volumes/NO\ NAME/:
cp greatfet_usb/greatfet_usb.bin /Volumes/NO\ NAME/greatfet.b1n
```

Eject the badge's USB mass storage device. You should now be able to select
your application as a rad1o application. You can always access the list of
applications-- and choose the startup application-- by holding LEFT on the
joystick as you start the badge.
