Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made GreatFET that much better:

	Ben Gamari
	Benjamin Vernoux <titanmkd@gmail.com>
	Dominic Spill <dominicgs@gmail.com>
	Jared Boone <jared@sharebrained.com>
	K. J. Temkin <k@ktemkin.com>
	Michael Ossmann <mike@ossmann.com>
	Mike Naberezny <mike@naberezny.com>
	Schuyler St. Leger <schuyler.st.leger@gmail.com>
	Mike Ryan <mike@bluetooth.expert>

A large amount of firmware comes from the HackRF project, copyright
should be determined from the git commit history of both this project and
the commits at https://github.com/mossmann/hackrf
